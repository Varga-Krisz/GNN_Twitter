# GNN_Twitter
Link prediction with graph neural networks on the Twitter dataset.

### Team Name: Me, myself, and I
### Members: Varga Kriszti√°n - PVQIYU

## File descriptions
The `nagyHF.ipynb` notebook contains all the necessary code for this project,
including the data and requirement downloads, data preparation, and the model training.

The data is preprocessed into a DataFrame of bag-of-words in the `feature_bow.pkl` file extracted from `feature_bow.rar`,
and `node2vec_trained.pt` is a node embedding pretrained on the train data.

The required `Documentation.pdf` is currently missing due to time constraints and there being no results worth documenting.
