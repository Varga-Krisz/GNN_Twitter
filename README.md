## File descriptions
The `nagyHF.ipynb` notebook contains all the model training for this project, with all background functions and classes found in `model.py`.

The data is preprocessed into a pandas DataFrame by the `data_processing.ipynb` notebook.
The `feature_bow.pkl` file extracted from `feature_bow.rar` contains the bag-of-words vectors of the nodes,
and `node2vec_trained.pt` is a node embedding pretrained on the train data.

The `Documentation.pdf` gives a longer description of what this project is about.
